In this data analysis project, we delve into the month-wise sales data of an electronic store to uncover meaningful insights. The analysis involves answering key questions such as identifying the month with the highest sales, determining the cities that contributed the most and least to the sales, exploring products frequently sold together, analyzing top-selling products, and examining the relationship between product quantity and price.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains month-wise sales data for the electronic store. It includes information on sales amounts, cities, and details about individual products.

### City-wise Sales

The analysis includes a breakdown of sales by city to highlight the locations that significantly contribute to the store's revenue and those that contribute the least.
